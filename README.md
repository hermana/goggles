# Online shopping goggle

A customizable goggle that filters searches to include only specific clothing or shoe sizes and sites based in a specific country (for currency and shipping). Goggles are used to filter searches with the Brave browser. You can learn more about them [here](https://github.com/brave/goggles-quickstart).

Here are the steps to using this goggle:

1. Clone the repo. 
2. Copy the text from the main goggle and put it in a new file in the /users/ folder. Make sure your file is named differently from any others, and try to stay close to this format: `online-shopping-<YOUR-NAME>.goggle`
3. Walk through the instructions in the copied goggle and edit it according to your sizes and preferences. 
4. When you're happy with it, commit and push the changes. 
5. Navigate to the url where your goggle lives in github. 
6. Submit the url to Brave [here](https://search.brave.com/goggles/create)
7. Great Success! 

If you have any problems or questions, feel free to add an issue in the repo. Enjoy your shopping!
